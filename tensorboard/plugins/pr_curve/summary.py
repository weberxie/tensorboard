  """Create a PR curve summary op for a single binary classifier.

  Computes true/false positive/negative values for the given `predictions`
  against the ground truth `labels`, against a list of evenly distributed
  threshold values in `[0, 1]` of length `num_thresholds`.

  Each number in `predictions`, a float in `[0, 1]`, is compared with its
  corresponding boolean label in `labels`, and counts as a single tp/fp/tn/fn
  value at each threshold. This is then multiplied with `weight` which can be
  used to reweight certain values, or more commonly used for masking values.

  Args:
    tag: A tag attached to the summary. Used by TensorBoard for organization.
    labels: The ground truth values. A Tensor of `bool` values with arbitrary
        shape.
    predictions: A float32 `Tensor` whose values are in the range `[0, 1]`.
        Dimensions must match those of `labels`.
    num_thresholds: Number of thresholds, evenly distributed in `[0, 1]`, to
        compute PR metrics for. Should be `>= 2`. This value should be a 
        constant integer value, not a Tensor that stores an integer.
    weight: Optional; A float or scalar float32 `Tensor`. Individual
        counts are multiplied by this value.
    display_name: Optional name for this summary in TensorBoard, as a
        constant `str`. Defaults to `name`.
    description: Optional long-form description for this summary, as a
        constant `str`. Markdown is supported. Defaults to empty.
    collections: Optional list of graph collections keys. The new
        summary op is added to these collections. Defaults to
        `[Graph Keys.SUMMARIES]`.

  Returns:
    A summary operation for use in a TensorFlow graph. The float32 tensor
    produced by the summary operation is of dimension (6, num_thresholds). The
    first dimension (of length 6) is of the order: true positives,
    false positives, true negatives, false negatives, precision, recall.
